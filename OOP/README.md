# Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming has a few benefits over procedural programming.

1. object-oriented programming allows you to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time;
2. object-oriented programs hide the implementation from the end-user.

Consider Python packages like Scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. These are all Python packages built with object-oriented programming. Scikit-learn, for example, is a relatively large and complex package built with object-oriented programming. This package has expanded over the years with new functionality and new algorithms.

When you train a machine learning algorithm with Scikit-learn, you don't have to know anything about how the algorithms work or how they were coded. You can focus directly on the modeling.

An object has two essential parts; *characteristics*, *actions*. Consider the followoing image of two object -  a salesperson and a shirt.

### Characteristics and Actions in English Grammar

Another way to think about characteristics and actions is in terms of English grammar. A characteristic would be a noun. On the other hand, an action would be a verb.

Let's pick something from the real-world: a dog. A few characteristics could be the dog's weight, color, breed, and height. These are all nouns. What actions would a dog take? A dog can bark, run, bite and eat. These are all verbs.

## Class, Object, Method, Attribute

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Vocabulary

1. **class** - a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes
2. **object** - an *instance* of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, a blue shirt, etc. 
3. **attribute** - a descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.
4. **method** - an *action* that a class or object could take
5. **OOP** - a commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming
6. **encapsulation** - one of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.
